I worked with the plot_split_chan_spe_0p5v.py and data there for a while. 

I can't seem to get things to look right. Resulting waveforms end up binning
bimodally. Not sure what to do about this. 

I suspect it has to do with the way the timestamp is determined. (BTW, that
time stamp is 1ps units. I confirmed this using a pulser). This data was taken using DPP-PSD with
each channel triggering independently, but using the time correlations software 
option. The channels were triggering using CFD, but I don't quite remember the settings. 

My understanding is that the timestamp (I think sometimes referred to as the time tag) is
the point of trigger: threshold crossing for leading edge disc or zero crossing for CFD

This has something to do with how that is determined, and the difficulty of backing that out
after the fact, if all you have is that timestamp and the raw waveform data.
